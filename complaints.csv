2023-08-07,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I have been trying to resolve this matter for over a year. XXXX XXXX asked me to help reconcile his account and I sent an email to customer care on XX/XX/XXXX. The email I received stated that he needed to give written authorization, which he did on XX/XX/XXXX. He died on XX/XX/XXXX. No one ever got back to me. I was told that I needed letters testamentary to get any information regarding the account. 
The probate process is long, and I received letters on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX. Their response on XX/XX/XXXX stated that my information would be forwarded to the appropriate department for review and processing. It never stated they had filed for foreclosure. I sent another email on XX/XX/XXXX requesting information because I had not heard from the company, and I learned that the property was being foreclosed on even though it was still in probate. 
They never properly informed me on this matter. No timely information was sent to resolve the matter before it was sent to foreclosure. In doing my research a letter was sent to me and the deceased at his property address on XX/XX/XXXX giving him 30 days to dispute. However, 2 days later a foreclosure in XXXX XXXX was filed on XX/XX/XXXX even though they knew the property was in probate. Then a duplicate letter was sent to me at the deceased address on XX/XX/XXXX. This seemed like a bad faith attempt. All letters addressed to me should have been sent to my address. When I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX this was within the XXXXday period of the XX/XX/XXXX letter, so a foreclosure should not have been filed. Their responses to me should have included the fact that they prematurely filed for foreclosure, so I do not feel that those fees are warranted. I asked for a waiver of the fees, and I never received a response to my request. The account was reinstated and I still have not received notice of cancellation of the foreclosure. 
I received the XXXX statement with assessed expenses of {$2400.00} and no explanation. When I called, I was told to look at the transaction part which had an assessed expense of {$100.00} for attorneys fees on XX/XX/XXXX but no other explanation. Customer service told me that they sent a reply to my waiver request to an XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of my office address or even the property address. 
It is unfortunate that no one is taking accountability for the multiple mistakes made in reconciliation of this account. No one seems to have any authority to give me requested information and correspondence is continually being sent to the wrong place even though my information has been given to you multiple times. Extra fees are still being added to the account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Ocwen Financial Corporation,TX,77545,,Consent provided,Web,2023-08-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7364084

2023-07-22,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"On XX/XX/XXXX I started my house buying process with XXXX XXXX at XXXX my original interest rate was 3.99 %. and locked in until XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my interest rate changed to 4.625. % and locked in until XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX it remained at 4.625 % and locked until XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX it remained at 4.525 % On XX/XX/XXXX it changed to 5.25 % and locked until XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX it remained 5.25 % My loan amount was for XXXX. 
I brought this issue to the mortgage lender attention he stated on XX/XX/XXXX that he had already requested XXXX extension and they cost money. He also stated due to difficulty with the appraisal that he forgot to lock in my rate and he was unable to do anything. I asked him to educate about me this process. He stated typically it takes XXXX days to close and since mines took over 30 days. He stated this led to the increase. The process was extended due to an low appraisal value and the appraisal company XXXX XXXX failure to respond in a timely manner. A request for review was made XX/XX/XXXX and an updated report was not provided until XX/XX/XXXX. 

This the email I sent to upper management XXXX XXXX of the mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the interest rack increase and the difficulty with the appraisal company. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX PM XXXX I am currently working with XXXX XXXX to close on my first home tomorrow. However, initially I was informed that my rate would be locked at 3.99 % ( XXXX and was due to expire on XXXX days ) during this period the appraisal was received on XX/XX/XXXX at {$160000.00}. A request for an accurate comparable to be made was requested the next day and the request was not updated or acknowledged until XXXX. Once corrected the value was assessed at {$180000.00}. I was informed by XXXX that he requested an extension however I see on XX/XX/XXXX the rate was increased to 4.6 % and expired on XX/XX/XXXX. However, on XX/XX/XXXX an extension was requested for the rate of 4.6 % which expired XX/XX/XXXX. The repairs requested from the appraisal were not completed until XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX an extension was requested for 4.6 % which expired XX/XX/XXXX. At this time a reinspection was requested for the completed repairs. On XX/XX/XXXX another rate increased occured which is 5.35 % and brought my monthly payment to {$1400.00}. Initially my estimated monthly payment was roughly {$1300.00} with a 4.6 %. It appears that the lock initially was for only 14 days and it was not extended although the appraisal was not ordered until XX/XX/XXXX and the report was not received until XX/XX/XXXX. The delay from appraisal occured and the correct report was not received until XXXX which at this time no rate was locked in due date lock expiring. A new rate was not locked in until XX/XX/XXXX. Initially mortgage XXXX was handling my paperwork well, but somehow between the miscommunication associated with the appraisal agency ( that is unprofessional and unethical ) and now this rate gouge has occurred has made this a stressful experience. 

I remained in contact with XXXX via text and phone from XXXX until I received the updated appraisal. I also requested a new appraisal free of cost because the XXXX appeared to be biased. I was informed that was not possible. 

No resolution was ever reached.

I am writing this letter because US Bank is refusing to return to me my account balance of {$9400.00}. US Bank told me that I am not allowed to withdraw the funds at the local branch if I visit them. Instead, US Bank first told me that they will mail me a check for the balance on my checking account after 7-10 business days, which means I may not receive a check via mail for 2 weeks. Next, US Bank told me that they have the right to hold my bank account balance for 90 days while they review my bank account. 

Despite visiting the local US Bank Branch in XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX, and making numerous phone calls to the US Bank fraud department, the US Bank bankruptcy department as well as the US Bank fraud liaison department, I was told again and again that nothing can be done to assist me further, and that they could not explain why they had chosen to close my account and hold on to my funds. I am in XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy and my attorney also sent them two letters telling them that it was illegal for them to place holds the funds in my bank accounts, to which they said they would lift all the holds, but a hold on my bank account balance remains in place as of this date. 

The hold on the funds in my bank account is creating an immediate, severe economic hardship for me and my husband. The bank 's actions have resulted in reversing my mortgage payment, reversing my XXXX XXXX XXXX utility payments ( resulting in my power being cut off ), and leaving me without any cash in my pocket for reasonable living expenses ( like food! ). I have also accumulated numerous late fees and bank return fees as a result of US Banks actions. My mortgage payment, my XXXX  XXXX payment as well as my electric payment have been returned and I have been charged additional late fees and bank return fees. 

Moreover, I am shocked by US Banks lack of customer service, downright meanness, inhumane and probably illegal behavior. It seems that US bank does not care if their actions put people on the street. 

Please force US Bank to return me the balance of my bank account funds immediately!

2023-07-21,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Trouble using the card,Trouble getting information about the card,"In XX/XX/2023 I opened an account with Wells Fargo reacting to the marketing offer. Starting in XXXX I have worked in the XXXX and to that effect I requested the bank to send me a paper bill to the XXXX address. The bill never arrived. 
Furthermore the bank apparently mispelled my US address therefore despite speaking with three people at the bank 's customer service I was given no assistance regarding the exact start of the account. 
The issue is that the marketing offer extended relates to spend of {$3000.00} within the 90 days of the account opening. Since the bank blocked my online access as I am using my device overseas ( foreign IP address ) as threat it also refused to provide me with the account opening date. I think this is done on purpose so the 90 days threshold is not met and this info is absolutely no way related to the account security. Furthermore the WF staff is utterly rude and unprofessional and instead of providing the solution to the problem such as this they just offer meaningless and ridiculous talking points which have absolutely no relation to reality",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,IL,60073,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7287496

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sold my house, and all outstanding balances were paid off to Caliber Home Loans at the closing. However, during the same period, XXXX XXXX XXXX was in the process of transferring my mortgage to Shellpoint Mortgage Services. After the closing, I discovered that Shellpoint Mortgage Services was erroneously reporting that my mortgage had not been paid off and listed it as delinquent on my credit report. 

Despite my attempts to provide proof of the mortgage 's closure and the payment made to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have been unable to rectify this situation with either company. As a result of this error by XXXX and Shellpoint, my ability to qualify for a mortgage or obtain any form of credit has been severely impacted, causing immense financial burdens and instability for myself and my family. 

I have diligently communicated with both companies and the credit bureaus to resolve this matter, but the situation remains unresolved. I am at a loss as to how to proceed further, and this ongoing issue is causing me significant emotional distress. As of today, Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, my credit report shows that I am 120+ days delinquent on a mortgage that no longer exists.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,34786,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7279412

Called the number listed and was asked to verify my phone number and secret word on the account. Both were matched. 
Then I was told my cell phone number could not be used to send out a code to verify my identity. 
I was then asked a barrage of personal questions, such as my maiden name, my mother 's maiden name, what other Citi accounts I have. 
They then asked me for another phone number or another person 's phone number to send a code to. I don't have another phone number and did not provide another person 's number to them. 
None of my answers worked, and none of that information was included in my application, so how would that be used to verify me? This in itself seems fraudulent. Where is that information being check against, and where is it now stored? 
Finally I was told I would have to wait for 5 to 10 days to receive a letter in the mail with a code and instructions to unlock my card. 
XX/XX/2023 : Made another call to see if I could get this resolved. The exact same process began again. Once she told me she could not send the text message, and started to ask for other personal information, I told her I was done with the call.

On XX/XX/2023, I received a credit reporting alert of a new credit inquiry. XXXX reported a credit inquiry that same day from Citibank NA., Best Buy. I immediately called Citibank at XXXX to dispute this credit reporting because I did not request an extension of credit or authorize the use of my information in any manner. I have excellent credit and was fearful the credit was open, but Citi confirmed it was denied. Citi never provided me a reason for denying the extension of credit, but during this call I was grateful Citi did not find it appropriate to approve the request. That same day I initiated a lock on my credit with all three credit reporting bureaus to prevent future attempts of fraud. 

On XXXX Citi called to verify my mailing address so they could send their final investigation results. A few days later I received Citi 's denial to remove the hard credit inquiry. Citi justified maintaining the reporting because all of my correct personal information was used to initiate the credit request. Because my personal information was fully used to make a credit inquiry, open an account, etc., does not negate fraudulent activity. I am disappointed by Citi 's failure to acknowledge attempted identity theft and the attempt to open an account with their financial institution using my personal information. Citi clearly found reasonable justification to deny the fraudulent attempt to open the credit account, but fails identity theft victims by refusing to remove incorrect credit reporting information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KY,41017,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7280843

I registered my account but was initially unable to log in. After troubleshooting on my own for a week, I called Citi Bank and was told it was an authentication error on their side. The customer service representative I spoke to said that they reset my account and that after 24 hours I should be able to register again and then log in.

After waiting 24 hours, I was unable to reset my card. During the following weeks, I would continuously contact Citi Bank customer service and request assistance with this issue. For most of these conversations, I was told that a ticket was opened under my account to address the issue and that it should be fixed. Every time I contacted Citi Bank, I was advised to wait and try again after a certain amount of time. The second to last time I contacted them, I was told to wait a little over a week, and that I would receive an email confirmation that the ticket was resolved. 

During this time I also tried to pay off my credit card statement over the phone, and I was initially told that I was unable to do so because they were unable to find the routing number of the credit union I use. This was eventually corrected on a different call, but was still troubling. 

However, the registration issue persisted. On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX several weeks after I first reported the issue and reached out to Citi Bank customer service, I was able to speak to a supervisor. Her name was XXXX, and she informed me that there was in fact no ticket associated with my account and that the only way to proceed was waiting 7 days to confirm my identity. At this point, my statement was due in 7 days, and she told me that I had no other options and that there was nothing that Citi Bank could do. 

This completely went against the previous information that Citi Bank had told me. The customer service that I've experienced has been the most unprofessional and unreliable I have ever experienced. Between the misinformation and miscommunication, I feel that this is a completely unreliable credit card service provider. I have spent close to 8 hours on the phone with Citi Bank customer service, and no solutions were found during this. This was not something that I did wrong, which the representatives I spoke to confirmed. This was an issue caused by Citi Bank, that they did not resolve, despite telling me it would soon be fixed. It should not take over a month and several frustrating phone calls to simply register for an account. 

I was also notified that there may be fraudulent activity on my account, but I have no way to confirm this. Even over the phone, I was told nothing. To me, this is completely unacceptable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KY,41017,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7281094

The Seller was charging {$350.00} per ticket and I was planning to buy 3 tickets so a total of {$1000.00}. The Seller requested payment through XXXX. Prior to sending the money, I called US Bank to ask if I was covered by my bank in case this ended up being a scam. I did my due diligence by looking into the person and asking specific questions and felt like it was legit. The customer service rep at US Bank told me that I would be covered if it was a scam and all I needed to do was to call back and dispute the charge on my checking account and a claim would be opened. Unfortunately, it ended up being a scam so I called US Bank and immediately disputed the charge and opened the claim. I was told that is would take 7-10 business days to hear a decision and if it was approved then it could take 45 days to get the money back. I asked what the likelihood of this being approved given the situation and was told it was very likely as I was clearly scammed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from US Bank telling me my claim was denied. On this letter there was no reason for denial and it says I can call US Bank and request an documents used in the investigation. I called US Bank and asked what was going on, the rep pulled up the claim and could not find any reason on her end or any documents used. The rep told me that she would reach out the claims rep and when she heard back she would call me. She never called me back. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called US Bank again to see what is going on with this claim. That rep asked if the letter gave a reason for the denial and I said no. They put me on hold to find out what was going on. When they returned all they said was it was denied and I could call the police and file a civil suit if I wanted to. When I asked, why I was told otherwise back on XX/XX/XXXX, I was not given an answer. I requested all of the documents that were used in the investigation to be mailed to me. I was lied to on multiple occasions by US Bank and how they handle this situation makes it hard to trust them.

2023-07-20,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,,"In XX/XX/2023, I took out a cash advance of {$750.00} from Truist Bank through the mobile app. I tried to pay off the loan and close my accounts on XX/XX/2023, resulting in Complaint # XXXX, where they refused to close my account. The reason the account wasn't closed was they were continuing to try to take a recurring payment for a credit card account that I had also closed the the same day. At the teller window, I told them about the line of credit and asked that it be paid off and closed at the same time. They did not have access to see the line of credit, and so when I stressed that I wanted to make sure it was paid off, they assured me all my debts were paid. 

Because the line of credit was not accessible to the teller, the line was not paid off, and the interest and fees continued to accrue. In addition, they tied the line of credit to my checking account and on XX/XX/2023, they reported both the line of credit and the checking account it was tied to as delinquent to the credit bureaus. I called the customer service lines and visited the branch and it wasn't until this week, XX/XX/XXXX, that the credit line debt was revealed. I am appalled that a bank could lend money and XXXX. ) Not allow someone to pay that money back at a bank location XXXX. ) Not keep a ledger or any records accessible on the app, by Customer Service, or by the branch employees, and XXXX. ) Not tell me about the debt until it was reported to the credit bureaus, and XXXX. ) Tie the debt to my checking account so that XXXX accounts were reported delinquent instead of just the line of credit. Moreover, I tried to close accounts, was denied the ability to close the accounts, reported the issue to this bureau and should have discovered then that there was an issue then, and not XXXX months later. 

I have since paid this off and I am now seeking to have this negative mark removed from my credit record. Having XXXX delinquent accounts has prevented me from getting a loan and has negatively affected my credit rating for XXXX months. Moreover, there was no transparency in this process and no one on the corporate side or the physical branch could or would help me until I planted myself in the branch office and refused to leave until they called corporate and figured out what the issue was. Even then, it took multiple visits to the branch and multiple phones from me and the banker to even figure out what the issue was. 

I am physically and mentally exhausted from this experience and appalled at the lack of transparency and complete lack of responsibility. I have been asked to provide cards and bank statements from accounts I thought I had closed, and repeated told to read my service agreements if I had an issue with my lack of responsibility in paying this.

As a result of their admission of fault in the result of cancelling my accounts without merit, I discovered they reported an open credit card account for the month of XXXX. 

Referring to the response from USAA on CFPB complaint XXXX : "" XXXX XXXX, XXXX staff facilitated a re-review of the decision to discontinue doing business with you. It was determined that the decision was made in error, and steps were taken to reverse the actions taken and the restrictions were removed. We addressed the identified opportunity with the individual involved, to ensure appropriate handling of similar situations moving forward. We regret any frustration you experienced. '' If you refer to the CFPB complaint, you will note that I was informed ( apparently ) on XX/XX/XXXX by "" XXXX '' that my accounts were closed. I learned this in a call with the Office of the CEO on XX/XX/XXXX - check the call recording. This was in the notes of the action made by "" XXXX  '' when she went to cancel me. In the attached document, you'll note the credit card was opened in XXXX, after I was cancelled by "" XXXX '', yet the result from the CFPB complaint was in XXXX. 

I have never used this account, did not have access to it, did not activate any cards with the account. 

I've tried to dispute this invalid credit card account via the Credit Bureaus, and so far XXXX has reported that USAA has rejected this as "" open '' still. At the same time that I closed the checking/savings account, I also asked to close this "" ghost '' credit card account. 

I have been rejected for new credit cards from other institutions because of this "" ghost '' account showing on my record. 

My credit score has dropped XXXX points as a result of these action ( s ) by USAA and the unjust retribution actions by employee "" XXXX  '', with USAA falling in line with those actions until CFPB complaint XXXX was filed and those unjust actions reversed.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,IN,477XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7278177

2023-07-20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I had a mortgage with Wells Fargo Moertgage and sold the house. They sent me a check of {$800.00} to return my Escrow, and I mistakenly did a mobile deposit twice to my checking accounts : once with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and again with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I was in the middle of moving interstate and made that error. Both banks rejected the mobile deposit on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( Wells Fargo ). I then tried to deposit the actual check at a XXXX branch 2 more times ( XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) sharing my original mistake and both times the check was rejected by Wells Fargo so each deposit was reversed by XXXX. The XXXX branch mgr was nice enough to get me on a call with WFargo on XX/XX/XXXX where I was told by XXXX that the check had a "" invisible void '' due to my deceased husband being listed on the check and to send in a fax to remove him from the account- which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. Mind you my Probate lawyer had notified WFargo of my husband 's death but they never removed him from the account. WFargo Mortgage was to reissue the Escrow Refund. Instead I receive an overnighted letter from WFargo on XX/XX/XXXX stating there would be no refund on Escrow as that check was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX ( Case # XXXX ). I have spent many hours with both WFargo Mortgage & WFChecking on the phone and they realize that the deposit was rejected by XXXX but no one can seem to issue me another Escrow refund. On XX/XX/XXXX after many frustrating hours on hold with XXXX from WFargo Mortgage, she opened up another case # : XXXX. That case was closed yesterday by XXXX stating I had deposited the check ( which I did not ). I called the number he gave me, and just got a random Escalation person, XXXX, who refused to escalate further and said I had to speak to XXXX even though she could see his email that the case was closed. XXXX was supposed to call me back and that has not happened. I have spent over 10 hours on hold trying to resolve this and just want my refund of {$800.00} and then I will move all of my funds from WFargo to XXXX where at least they respond and resolve customer issues. Wells Fargo never gives out employees last names, emails or contact phone numbers so it is impossible to resolve an issue and each person just wants to close the case as quickly as possible.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TN,37415,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7277505

2023-07-20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/2023, I paid {$5300.00} for two XXXX air conditioning condensers ( model XXXX XXXXXXXX ) using a CitiCard. At the time of the purchase I made arrangements with my installer, a regular customer of the AC seller, to pick up the units from the seller. 

After my installer went AWOL without having picked up the units from the seller, I called the seller to cancel the order and the seller agreed that they would not now release the units to the installer because the order was cancelled. However, the seller would not give me a refund ; bizarrely, the seller now claimed that the company policy was not to deal with the purchaser ( and only deal with the installer ). The seller advised me to seek redress by contacting Citi card to have the transaction voided, and my card credited. 

I made a formal request to Citi to credit my account for the merchandise that I did not receive but paid for. And I made sure to advise Citi that the merchandise still resided with the seller, as I confirmed with the seller over the phone and by email on XXXX XXXX. 

Citi responded by asking for a sales invoice as proof of purchase and/or confirmation of the lack-of-delivery/entitlement-to-a-refund. I explained to Citi that because I made a phone order, there WAS no invoice. I reminded Citi also I had indeed confirmed ( by the email that I had already shared with Citis investigator ) that the seller agreed to void the sale and hold onto the merchandise. I recommended that their investigator should simply call the seller to confirm : 1 ) that I used the Citicard for the purchase ; 2 ) that the order was canceled and ; 3 ) that my installer never picked up the units that I purchased. 

Bottom line : the seller held onto my purchase. I paid {$5300.00} that was never refunded and Citi failed in its duty sufficiently to investigate the claim on my behalf, looking to me as cardholder essentially to perform their investigation for them. Citi failed to credit my account by simply recovering the funds from the seller, AS THE SELLERS AGENT RECOMMENDED AS A SOLUTION. 

I am not now attaching documentation, since Citi has already collected that material and has it in its file.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,190XX,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7270502

Despite my requests, the company refused to accept the return of the car. I no longer desired this vehicle as it did not match my initial purchase expectations. For the past XXXX years, this car has functioned without proper air conditioning. Moreover, the car 's system frequently malfunctions while driving, causing unexpected stops in traffic. The information provided about the vehicle was deceitful and manipulative. I never agreed to pay for a car under these circumstances, and I find this manipulation highly unjust. The promise was that I would receive an operational and safe car for my family, which clearly hasn't been fulfilled. It's unfair that my family now bears this financial burden without a reliable vehicle, especially considering the needs of my XXXX child. I refuse to make payments for a car that is inoperable, as it was not part of our agreement. Despite my request, I haven't received the original contract, and the contract you attempted to provide is fraudulent and not signed by me. The Truth in Lending Act ( XXXX ), which is a federal law, mandates that lenders disclose specific information to borrowers regarding the terms and costs of the loan. This includes providing a written contract or agreement that clearly outlines the terms of the loan, such as interest rates, payment schedules, and any applicable fees. Sending a fraudulent contract is against the law. I insist on receiving the original contract before any further communication or payments. I will not make any additional payments for a car that can not be operated. XXXX years ago, returning the car was not allowed due to the representations made by your staff and the dealership, claiming no returns were possible.

2023-07-19,Debt collection,Other debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I have been experiencing issues with I.C. Systems regarding an alleged debt that they have been reporting on my consumer report. The debt amount is listed as {$1500.00}, and I have been disputing its validity since XXXX of 2022. Despite multiple attempts to request verification of this debt, I.C. Systems has not provided any supporting documentation to prove its validity. 

On XXXX, I sent my XXXX and final letters to XXXX XXXX I.C. Systems, requesting proof of the alleged debt and how they determined it meets the requirements for reporting. However, they have continuously disregarded my letters and have persistently reported the debt to my consumer report without providing any verification. Additionally, I successfully submitted a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) complaint # XXXX about this unverifiable debt approximately a month ago. Logged in to the CFPB portal today to check the status but somehow my complaint can not be found. I.C. Systems has continued to report the debt XXXX more times within a two-week period. The most recent update was reported on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX I believe that I.C. Systems ' actions are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Their failure to provide adequate verification and their continuous reporting of an unverified debt have negatively impacted my creditworthiness and caused unnecessary distress. 

I am seeking resolution in the form of a cease reporting, where I.C. Systems immediately stops reporting this unverified debt to my consumer report until they can provide adequate proof of its validity. I request that they comply with the FCRA and FDCPA regulations to ensure accurate and lawful reporting practices. If they fail to cease reporting within a reasonable time frame, I request that appropriate fines be imposed on I.C. Systems, amounting to {$1000.00} for each day the unverified debt remains on my consumer report.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope for a swift resolution to address these violations.

2023-07-19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"My complaint is with the Pay Bill Process at Bank of America Credit Card using online or mobile app. 

My bill was due on XX/XX/2023 and I wanted to schedule the payment and amount using my checking account information. I used the mobile app which steered me to the ebill and payment process. My intension was to enter my bank routing # and acct # along with the amount and date to make payment but it appears as if Bank of America wants to force customers to schedule payment and amount but before they do so their process verifies that you have an account with the bank and that it has sufficient monies in the acct to make payment. So to verify that the account is valid, they will send 2 small deposits to my account then shortly thereafter debit my account to retrieve the monies. I have a problem with this. 

I don't like any company going into my account. If the account balance is not sufficient to cover the payment that is my problem as a customer and I should be charged whatever fees are appropriate for insufficient payment. I do not need to have Bank of America monitor my ability to manage my checking account. I believe the Bank has over stepped boundaries with customer bill paying. 

In addition, my bank account information would be stored on the screen as well as in their databases which I don't like a result of the rise in data breaches being reported. As Bank of America is not my primary bank and is just a temporary creditor, I do not want to store my bank information. 

The one-time payment option which is suppose to exist will not work unless it includes the verified bank information. So each time a one-time payment is made, the verify process will be invoked. Thus, can't make one-time payment on line or through the mobile app, because they both use the IVR process XXXX 

The one-time payment can only be made using the phone. This is not very convenient and does not work like other banks bill pay process.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,10025,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7273943

I was alarmed because I have never done business with XXXX ever in my life. I immediately checked my credit report for other fraudulent activity, but found none. I then disputed the collections with all three of the credit bureaus, but found Amsher later supposedly verified the information, which is again false. Amsher sent me the bill from XXXX that they were basing their information on, and I found it was from and address that I haven't lived at for over 10+ years. Amsher sent me a form for identity theft and instructed me to complete it and sent to XXXX, but again they never verified that I opened the account with a SSN #, signed document, store that they were purchased at..nothing, because again it was not me. I contacted XXXX directly and created a case with them ( case # XXXX ), but have yet to hear anything back from them. I have emailed Amsher several times asking to speak to a XXXX to have this fraudulent collections removed, but have not heard anything back. After looking up online what should I do, I found that many other consumers have had the exact issues with both XXXX and Amsher Collections. When I contacted XXXX, they could not verify the XXXX # that the phones were purchased with, and there was no hit on my credit reports ( hard or soft hit ) on my credit report for XXXX. It appears that Amsher found the matching name and previous address on my credit reports and simply applied the collections to my credit report with any due diligence on their part.

Recently, I fell victim to a wire transfer scam when I wired {$9400.00} from XXXX to Citibank to purchase a watch as a wedding gift from my wife to me. Unfortunately, the seller never sent the watch and disappeared. To confirm that it was a scam, I conducted an email test from a different account. Since then, I have filed an XXXX report, a police report ( XXXX from XXXX, XXXX ), and an FTC report XXXX XXXX ) regarding this incident. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made the wire transfer and realized it was a scam. I promptly filed a claim with the XXXX claims department and initiated a recall on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, Citibank has requested a police report and a hold harmless letter. XXXX provided both the police report ( XX/XX/XXXX ) as well as the hold harmless letter to Citibank ( sent via physical mail on XX/XX/XXXX and via fax on XX/XX/XXXX ). However, Citibank is unable to process a recall as they are unable to contact the beneficiary to return the funds and advised me to contact the beneficiary directly to resolve this matter. I am unsure how I can contact the scammer to recover the funds. 

Even with the cooperation of authorities like the police department and FBI, the inconsistent responses and lack of support from Citibank have added to my frustration and distress. I understand that I made a mistake, as many people do at some point in their lives, and I take responsibility for it. However, I was trying to save as much money as possible, as those funds were intended for our wedding gift. This situation has left me deeply devastated. I have always believed that a reputable bank like Citibank would stand by its customers, not the scammers. I had hoped for assistance in recovering the funds from the scammer 's bank. I implore you to please offer any help in resolving this case and recovering the funds.

Its my understanding that XXXX has contacted FNBO and they are saying that can't speak with them about the issue or use the Miss applied balance info that has been sent because they are not the customer and that my husband and I will have to do this. They have also completed a dispute for us just yesterday after two months of requesting help after a manager at XXXX and FNBO spoke and disagreed on the next steps. We have been told in no uncertain terms that XXXX can do nothing else for us. Listen to all the recorded calls please. 

Contacted FNBO as requested by XXXX. We usually can not get farther than the associate- although lately, we have been able to get a manager to discuss. FNBO says that it is XXXX that needs to resolve this. I have sent a copy of the cashed check to FNBO 4 times to the accounting department. Apparently, because the check has not been applied to an account it is in limbo. So they say it is XXXX  that we need to talk to.

I was told that to remove the charge I would have to enter two amounts of {$250.00} and the charge would be deleted.

So I went to the bank and had those wire transfers completed. I did NOT instruct the teller to charge my two credit card accounts. I wanted the money taken from my checking account. 
Of course there was no {$25000.00} in my checking account. 
So, without my consent, or even my knowledge, my two credit cards were charged {$25000.00} If the banker had asked me where to get where to get the funds, it would have been apparent it was a scam, but SHE DID NOT ASK. She arbitrarily and without my permission, charged my two accounts.

2023-07-19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"As a consumer, I have encountered inaccurate and misleading information on my credit reports, which has resulted in significant harm to my financial well-being. I believe that these credit reporting agencies have violated the provisions outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ).

The specific violation involves the failure of credit reporting agencies to provide accurate and complete information about my credit history, resulting in the misrepresentation of my creditworthiness to potential lenders, employers, and other entities that rely on credit reports for decision-making purposes. I have diligently monitored my credit reports and found multiple instances where outdated, incorrect, or unverified information has been reported, thereby undermining my ability to access credit and obtain favorable terms. 

According to 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information contained in consumer reports. Furthermore, they must conduct a reasonable investigation within 30 days of receiving a dispute regarding the accuracy of any information on a consumer 's credit report. However, the credit reporting agencies in question have failed to fulfill these obligations, thereby violating my rights as a consumer. 

I have made multiple attempts to dispute and rectify these inaccuracies directly with the credit reporting agencies. However, their responses have been unsatisfactory, often providing generic and unhelpful explanations without conducting thorough investigations or taking appropriate corrective actions. These actions not only harm my financial reputation but also undermine the integrity and reliability of the credit reporting system. 

Considering these circumstances, I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate actions against the credit reporting agencies involved. I believe that enforcement actions, penalties, and the implementation of stringent compliance measures are necessary to ensure that credit reporting agencies comply with the requirements of 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) and safeguard the rights of consumers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,32211,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7274802
2023-07-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have this loan for approximately 7 years and pay on an auto payment that is {$70.00} higher than the amount due. The property is two units on one lot or parcel number. In mid XX/XX/2023 I received an auto dialer call asking me to call LoanCare. I called and the lady I eventualy got on the phone explained my payment was short due to an increase {$300.00} per month in the cost of insurance. I explained that was incorrect and we got the insurance department on the phone. It turns out they misread my policy and didnt realize my insurance covered both units and so they added lender paid insurance for one unit at a cost of {$3000.00} a year and thats what raised my payment. They said to not worry about it and they would fix it asap. 
I followed up at the end of XXXX and was told they were working on it still. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the credit bureau notified me my credit has dropped XXXX points due to a 30 day late to LoanCare. I instantly called them and was eventually hung on during a transfer. This happened 3 times on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. Each call was close to 45 minutes before the supposed transfer to an escalator or supervisor. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I called 3 more times before finally reaching an "" escalation '' person as there are no supervisors. She was nice and we spent close to 90 minutes going through everything. She said the lender paid insurance was removed but my payment was still {$300.00} higher per month but couldnt explain why. She did say my actual insurance was paid twice this year but at a cost of {$800.00} per year it wouldnt have increased my payment that much. She recommneded I pay the difference and she would email me an escrow breakdown. I never received any email. I asked to speak with someone to help with the mark on my credit, she explained that department does not use phones apparently and told me to fax them. I have sent that fax twice with no response or change. 
On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I missed a call from the insurance department at Loancare. I called back and it took me 3 tries again and over 2 hours to get a person on the phone. She didnt understand my insurance policy somehow and was asking me questions about it but couldnt seem to grasp the concept of 2 units on one loan. I asked my insurance company to reach out as well and theyve had a similar experience. 
In summary I would really appreciate someone not working from home with kids screaming in background and dogs barking to please call me and help get this impound account corrected, and correct the late on my credit.

I was traveling to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX where I live, which is where the charges were made. I received an automated text message from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX with whom I bank and have my credit card through alerting me to possible fraud. I acknowledged the text message with a "" Y '' and called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX when I saw that the two charges were on my credit card statement and noticed that I no longer had my credit card and that it had been compromised. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo canceled my credit card, credited the balance to my account, and sent me a new credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the fraud charges were placed back on my account. I called Wells Fargo and they told me that they found the charges to be valid because I authorized the charges when I responded to their automated text on XX/XX/XXXX with a "" Y ''. I explained to them that I did not realize I was authorizing any charges, and that I was acknowledging their message. I asked to have the claim reopened and that I could submit documentation showing that the credit card used to make those charges was never associated or linked to an XXXX XXXX account. I submitted the documentation via mail after multiple failed attempts from my local Wells Fargo branch to fax the documentation with the fax numbers provided. Wells Fargo again denied my claim despite me showing that I did not have an XXXX XXXX account. They were never able to identify or get in touch with the two merchants to whom the charges were made. The two charges were : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA for {$450.00} and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA for {$85.00}. Wells Fargo told me that because I have other charges from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA that I must have known the first merchant. I explained to them that XXXX XXXX  is a local coffee shop here in XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that they do not have a location outside of XXXX XXXX XXXX and that it is not the same as the merchant that {$450.00} went to. I have asked Wells Fargo to reopen the case three times and each time they denied it for the same reason. I am not responsible for both of the charges that I did not make despite me never having had an XXXX XXXX account linked to the compromised card, AND my card not being in my possession at the time.

2023-07-19,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"XXXX XXXX checking account was hacked into on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, at approximately, XXXXXXXX XXXX. The XXXX did a wire transfer to XXXX without my authorization. 
I was able to detect it fast as I was online in the process of doing a XXXX transfer. I had previous done XXXX XXXX successfully but on this occasion I forgot to tick the box to continue. It took me forty-minutes to figure out that I had forget to remember to to tick the box to say its not a scam to proceed and click continue. I hardly ever send by XXXX but do receive XXXX from my clients. 
Seem I wasnt successful with sending XXXX so I logged out of my account and back in within in 5 minutes I noticed {$8.00}, XXXX was taken out of my account. 
It happened with the 5 plus minutes I had logged out and back in. As a result I called Wells Fargo immediately. 
I noticed the scammed wire Transfer was pending so asked in panic while on the phone to a representative to stop the unauthorized transfer as it perhaps wasnt complete if it was pending. 
I did not authorize this transaction. 
I was directed 5 times to finally a representative to plead my case and stop further unauthorized fraud that could take place. Finally they registered my fraud claim. I asked to credit to my account but presently it has not happened as I needed money to pay bills. 
During my own investigation I noticed the Hacker created the name, XXXX XXXX as a new XXXX recipient with an email address of XXXX. But he did not do a XXXX transaction. I do not know this person at all. 
The wire transfer went to a XXXX in XXXX. Looking at the wire transfer - that he filled out pretending to me, he first had to fill all fields in including his own bank details which his account ended in XXXX. 
When asked in the field what the money was for- he said it was for Travel expenses. 
One must understand, I had no intensions of going to XXXX, I do not have or never had any flight booking or hotels paid for. Doesnt make sense to send money to someone to pay for my flight hotels and expenses etc, I can do that myself which is obvious. 
If i had it made booking it would have shown up in my Wells Fargo account. 
Its also worth mentioning that in the past wire transfers I did to XXXX which were many going back yrs- were successful and had no issues. 
The bank charged me a wire transfer fees to XXXX for goods and services. With the scammed wire transfer - no fee by the bank was charged which is weird as banks always charge a wire transfer fee. 
I also never received or had seen a text message on my phone to to authorize and or reject such transaction. If i had, i would have immediately rejected it as fraud. 
I herby state that the above information is correct to my recollection and ability. I did not authorize this transaction. I do not know anyone in XXXX. Nor am to receive any goods or services from such a person. 
My account was hacked into and I cant tell you how as I do not have the comprehension the DNA to know how it is achieved. 
As a result i would like Well Fargo Bank to reinstate the full amount of {$8500.00} asap so that I can continue to pay bills and have peace of mind.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,92234,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7275477

2023-07-19,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Mortgage Escrow department refuses to apply reductions in projected property tax obligations. They are basing escrow on tax status of previous owner. They are knowingly retaining excessive portion of my mortgage payment without interest. 
I have attempted since XX/XX/XXXX to get their Tax department to correct their errors without success. Copies of all changes affecting the reduction of my property taxes was forwarded to the Escrow department and it is recorded with XXXX XXXX XXXX department that on XX/XX/XXXX they accessed and verified the changes. 

Assessed value of the property was reduced from {$540000.00} in XXXX to {$390000.00} in XXXX. The reduction in assessed value lowered property from {$4700.00} in XXXX to {$3400.00} in XXXX. 

Ownership of the property changed in XX/XX/XXXX. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Veteran. The approved annual deduction is {$1500.00}. {$750.00} reduction in tax obligation applied to XX/XX/XXXX payment and {$750.00} applied to XX/XX/XXXX. 

The result of the two reductions has lowered property tax from {$4700.00} in XXXX to {$1900.00} in XXXX. A major reduction!!!! The escrow payment for taxes is reduced from $ XXXX in XXXX to {$150.00} in XXXX. A $ XXXX mo reduction in escrow withholding. The Escrow department added a {$50.00}. / mo deficiency withholding, giving a total excess of {$280.00} being withheld each month for 12 months. 

The correct calculation of Escrow payment ; Taxes $ XXXX = {$150.00} Insurance $ XXXX = {$100.00} Escrow Payment {$250.00} The {$280.00} / mo withheld by the mortgage without interest should be applied to my principal, reducing my interest charges and elimination of my debt. The knowingly misappropriating my funds should be considered a criminal act.

I am in a never ending loop between TransUnion and XXXX XXXX  in which they are complicit in KNOWINGLY Violating my Rights. 
XXXX XXXX brought a lawsuit against me in the District Court. The case was decided in my favor. 
I have a Judgement of Dismissal that explicitly states '' On the above claim, the Court has, upon dismissal, DISMISSED this claim... This means the defendant DOES NOT have to pay the plaintiff ANY PART of the claim or costs in this claim. '' Dated for XX/XX/XXXX. 
This document was sent to all parties involved in the lawsuit. Reporting that I owe ANY amount to ANY credit reporting agency AFTER receiving this Judgment of Dismissal is unlawful. 
After noticing this Account was still reporting on my Credit Report, I disputed this account with TransUnion. On XX/XX/XXXX By certified mail, I sent a dispute disputing this account and also sending in the Judgement of Dismissal that I received from the Courts to prove this account was NO LONGER ABLE TO REPORT as I DID NOT OWE THEM ANYTHING and the entire account must be removed. TransUnion went through their process and determined the account was VERIFIED by XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, by Certified Mail, I disputed this same account with TransUnion again, asking for a reinvestigation, and again sending in my documents from the court Verifying the account in question that was being Disputed with XXXX XXXX  was actually the account being shown in the Judgement for Dismissal. TransUnion concluded their reinvestigation and deemed the account to be VERIFIED and ACCURATE, despite having a copy of the Court order and this information being easily accessible online. A quick online search of Massachusetts Court Records would easily verify that the case was heard and dismissed. Today, I decided to call XXXX XXXX using the number listed on the account on my credit report. The number did not belong to XXXX XXXX but belonged to XXXX XXXX, who is servicing XXXX XXXX accounts. The representative looked up my account and said the only way to have this account removed from Credit Reporting is to pay it. I asked to be transferred. The person I was transferred to told me the same thing. I asked to be transferred to a Manager. The person who took the call did not identity themselves as a manager but proceeded to read from a LONG DOCUMENT making sure to finish, getting louder if I interjected. She basically read a document that explained that the case was Dismissed WITH Prejudice ( they have the document from the Judge ) which means that the LEGAL part of the account was closed, they could not pursue legal action but could still report the account to the Credit Reporting Agencies. Which makes absolutely no sense. She then proceeds to tell me the only way to have the account removed is to pay it. I have a Judgment of Dismissal for this account from the Courts which BOTH TransUnion and XXXX XXXX  refuse to acknowledge. This account has remained on my Credit Report for almost a year after the determination by the courts. I continue to pay High interest rates, have been denied a school loan for my daughter to attend college, and went through an immense amount of mental anguish which persists to this very day due to this issue I am having with TransUnion and XXXX Funding. Laws are put in place to prevent this very situation and TransUnion and XXXX XXXX are acting as if they are both above the Law. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices ' Act IS THE LAW.

This letter serves as my second attempt to dispute these inaccuracies. It is evident that both TransUnion and XXXX are in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by failing to list my correct personal information. 

Upon thorough examination of my credit reports from TransUnion and XXXX, I discovered multiple discrepancies that are detrimental to my financial well-being. The inaccuracies persistently include the following : 1. Incorrect Name : Despite my previous dispute, the credit reports continue to list my name as [ Incorrect Name ]. I reiterate that my correct legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and it is essential that you update this information immediately. 

2. Ongoing Inclusion of Outdated Address : In blatant disregard for my initial dispute, both TransUnion and XXXX have failed to rectify the issue of an outdated address ( [ Old Address ] ) appearing on my credit reports. This address has no relevance to my current residential status. I demand that you promptly remove this outdated information and replace it with my correct residential address, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXX The persistent and willful negligence in rectifying these inaccuracies showcases a serious violation of the FCRA. These erroneous entries have far-reaching consequences on my financial reputation and opportunities. It is imperative that TransUnion Consumer Solutions and XXXX take immediate action to rectify this situation in accordance with the provisions of the FCRA. 

I demand the following actions be taken : 1. Conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the inaccurate personal information stated above. 

2. Correct all erroneous information on my credit reports without further delay, ensuring that my correct name and address are accurately reflected. 

3. Provide me with written confirmation of the investigation 's progress, along with a detailed plan and timeline for resolving these inaccuracies. 

Failure to comply with these demands and rectify the inaccuracies within the stipulated time frame will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter further, seeking legal remedies to protect my rights as a consumer under the FCRA. 

I expect TransUnion Consumer Solutions and XXXX to treat this dispute with the utmost seriousness and urgency it deserves. Timely resolution of these discrepancies is not only crucial for my financial stability but also for upholding the integrity and credibility of your credit reporting agencies. 

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter. I demand a prompt written response detailing the actions taken to address these inaccuracies and restore the accuracy of my credit reports within 15 business days from the date of this letter.

2023-07-18,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"I opened the Savings account at the Wells Fargo branch on XX/XX/XXXX. 
It was opened with the {$520.00} promotion. The requirements were : - Open a new Savings account by XX/XX/XXXX - Bring XXXX XXXX  or more in new money to the account by Day 30 after the account opening date - Maintain XXXX XXXX through Day 90 after the account opening date The corresponding promotion screenshots are attached. 

I fulfilled all the requirements above - opened the account- on XX/XX/XXXX - deposited - {$300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$50.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$50.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$9600.00} and {$15000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX - {$25000.00} in total by XX/XX/XXXX - maintained that amount - by XX/XX/XXXX. 
See the attached statements. 

I didnt receive the bonus by the expected date. The Wells Fargo representative said I havent fulfilled all the promo requirements and become ineligible for the bonus. 
I raised a complaint to get more details on that. They responded that I didnt fulfill the XXXX XXXX deposit part. It turned out that they dont count deposits made on the first day, within the account opening as new money for that XXXX XXXX threshold. So they didnt count those {$300.00} I deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I strongly disagree with that. I believe those {$300.00} deposited within the account opening must be counted under the promotion. 
The definition of new money ( see the attached screenshots for the promo details ) : New money is money that is new to the customer or new to Wells Fargo ( deposited into the customers new savings account directly from outside of Wells Fargo and Company and all affiliates, or from a Wells Fargo account not owned by the customer ). 
It does NOT say that money deposited within the account opening or later on the Day 1 is not counted as new money. 
Those {$300.00} I deposited on XX/XX/XXXX are new to Wells Fargo and were deposited in the account from outside. So it totally aligns with the definition above. 

I believe I fully fulfilled all promo requirements and should get that {$520.00} bonus. Otherwise, that promo should be treated as a false advertisement.

I did attempt to reach out to customer service and spoke with a supervisor. I was informed that no further information could be provided and there was nothing that could be done. I was also then informed that the {$150.00} in cash-back credit rewards would not be paid out due to the closing of my card. 

I am completely convinced this card was closed because I always paid it on time and they never accumulated interest. I have all records to show my XXXX  payment and am happy to provide them. This is discrimination against a hard-working, honest, tax-paying business owner.

When purchases are made to the account under a promotional incentives the purchase price is added to the monthly balance When merchandise is purchased under promotional offers such as no interest for 6 months, that total is divided up and added into your monthly payment. When payments are made to the account the promotional portion of the payment is not applied to the account. Each month I make payments above the minimum payment and I have to call Amazon Prime Store Card to have my additional payments applied to the promotional charge otherwise my payments are not allocated correctly. Recently I received my monthly statement and noticed a interest fee of {$120.00}, my usual interest fee is between $ XXXX {$40.00}. I called Amazon Prime Card with Synchrony Bank and was advised that it was because I did not pay my promotional offer in full before it expired and now it was being added to my payment. I told the representative that I've been making above minimum payments each month and the additional payment should have been applied directly to the promotional offers. After reviewing my latest statement I request all my past statements since 2019 to see how often this had happened. I have also had several issues with returned credits to my account. I mail items back and receive a refund immediately then 2-6 months later I am recharged for the item, Amazon representatives advise me its because the return was never received but the tracking reflects it was sent back. After doing some research I discovered that returns are sent to warehouses where the merchandise sits for months on end and isn't processed. If the ware house doesn't process the returned item then the customer is automatically recharged.

It seems almost intentional that they close my account on the same day that they receive nearly {$1000.00} from me AND on the purchase I make that would finally put me over the line for receiving that sign up bonus.

Unfortunately its instructions about how to regain online access did not work properly, so on XX/XX/XXXX ( I believe ) I spent several hours at the new US Bank branch while the employee enabled access to my new accounts at US Bank. 
On XX/XX/2023 {$5000.00} was electronically transferred out of one of my personal checking accounts at U.S. Bank. I was provided no notice of this transfer. 
On XX/XX/2023 {$5000.00} was electronically transferred out of one of my business checking accounts at U.S. Bank. I was provided no notice of this transfer. 
On XX/XX/2023 {$10000.00} was wired out of another of my personal checking accounts at U.S. Bank. I was provided no notice of this transfer. 
The night of XX/XX/XXXX I logged onto my US Bank accounts online and noticed only {$400.00} in an account that previously had over {$10000.00}. The next morning I called and arranged to meet with my local branch after finding these fraudulent transactions in these three accounts. 
The bank closed these accounts and opened new ones and replaced my checks. At the same time, we overheard another couple talking with another banker about fraud on their accounts. 
About 15 days later the bank 's Digital Claims Services mailed three letters ( dated XX/XX/2023 ). The one pertaining to wire fraud said I "" authorized the wire transfer '' ( which is factually inaccurate ) and "" We have investigated the matter and requested that the beneficiary bank return the transferred funds. Unfortunately, the beneficiary bank did not accept or acknowledge the request ; we are unable to further assist in this matter. '' The two letters pertaining to electronic transfer fraud stated "" During our investigation, we determined the transaction posted as requested ; therefore, your claim has been denied. '' I met with the local branch manager again a few days later, who promised to escalate my case, but personally got no help from the corporate office. 
I have spent over XXXX hours on the phone with the Wires Department, Fraud Department, and Online Banking and have received no help in getting information about the receiving bank and account number that would enable me to follow up. 
US Bank has taken no responsibility for enabling access to my account. 
I have contacted my employer 's IT company about this situation, and was given their opinion that a breach of my account likely took place while security was reduced while the employee gave me online access.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,WA,98012,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7268922

2023-07-18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have a Citibank XXXX credit card that I currently have two deferred interest payments setup. These were both created using balance transfer offers. Once of these balances was setup with 0 % interest and is currently due on XX/XX/XXXX. The other balance was setup recently with a 0.99 % interest rate and it is due XX/XX/XXXX. I intended to pay off the 0 % interest balance in full before the transfer offer expires on XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank has informed me that due to the way their system is setup that any payment I make will be applied to the higher interest rate balance first. This would make sense normally but not in this case. I explained this to the representative and the supervisor today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) but I was unable to convince them to pay off the balance that is due XX/XX/XXXX. While I was on the phone I found a webpage on the Citi site that states the following... 
Amounts over the Minimum Payment Due are generally used to pay off higher rate balances first. 

- Any amount paid in excess of your minimum payment due each month will be paid to your highest interest rate balance first. 
- The only exception to this is the 2-3 billing cycles at the end of a deferred interest promotion. During this time we will apply any payment in excess of your minimum payment due to your expiring promotion. This will ensure you continue to have the best opportunity to pay your promotional balances before expiration. 

https : //www.citicards.com/cards/wv/copy.do? XXXX Please notice the 2nd sentence that is exactly for the situation I am in. It states that I can make a payment within 2-3 BILLING CYCLES to pay off the balance that is EXPIRING. 

Citibank officials explained to me that I must wait until 3 days after this cycle ends ( XX/XX/XXXX ) so that my expiring balance will not be the higher interest rate balance and they can apply my payment to that balance. Unfortunately I would be responsible for interest payments to them because my balance transfer would have expired. 

I am very angry about the lack of assistance and even after I had read them THEIR statement on their website they refused to pay off my expiring balance.

Multiple disputes with documentation have been submitted to the credit bureaus and the reporting student loan servicer. 

There are two student loans from XXXX in the amounts of {$99000.00} and {$120000.00} showing on my credit report with TransUnion and XXXX. These loans were consolidated in XXXX and transferred at that time from XXXX to XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, the loans were forgiven under XXXX. Erroneously, TransUnion and XXXX still reflect that these loans are open with XXXX. I filed disputes with TransUnion on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The results of each of these disputes indicate the information was verified as accurate. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX and spoke with a representative named XXXX to request that the loan status be corrected with the credit bureau reporting. XXXX confirmed the accounts in question were closed with {$0.00} balances and were being reported that way to the credit bureaus. She advised me to send an email to their Customer Solution team at XXXX. I did so on the same date along with providing screenshots of my credit reports. Unfortunately, I did not receive a response to my emailed request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX again to inquire about the status of my email to Customer Solutions. I spoke with XXXX who verified my accounts in question were closed with {$0.00} balances and were reporting to the credit bureaus that way. I asked to be transferred to another representative who may have insight behind the scenes of the systems hoping for a resolution. I was then transferred to Specialist 1, XXXX XXXX She reviewed my account further and said she could see the problem and believed the issue was on their end and tied to a credit suppression policy that was put into place during COVID-19. She said she would need more time to work with her counterparts and she would follow up with me in a few weeks once she resolved the issue. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by XXXX Specialist 1, XXXX XXXX She stated that unfortunately she was unable to resolve the issue with my account due to the credit suppression policy. She did not know when the policy would change allowing the closed loans to be correctly reported to the credit bureaus. I was advised to continue disputing the amounts with the credit bureaus as well as submitting a complaint to Federal Student Aid or Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She also suggested I contact XXXX since the loans were originally consolidated and transferred to them. I explained that XXXX is accurately reflecting/reporting the loans as closed and with {$0.00} balances.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TX,77433,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7276672

I would think that in circumstances as a suspected account take-over that there would be better options to receive service and speak with a live agent. 

I would like for an Experian agent to reach out to me as soon as possible to rectify the apparent fraud, and then I would like to receive a copy of my latest report so I can ascertain if there are any fraudulent activities being reported.

The caller identified himself as XXXX XXXX employee # XXXX and proceeded to tell me he was putting a stop on the transfer and asked many questions regarding the supposed recipient - XXXX XXXX and referring to possibly a XXXX in XXXX FL. He put a stop on my ATM card and issued a new card and that this would be handled. I saw on the account that the transfer had been initiated. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received another call from the same number identifying as Wells Fargo Fraud Detection about another wire transfer. The caller identified herself as XXXX XXXX employee # XXXX. This was a transfer of {$7000.00} and also some XXXX XXXX transactions. I denied all of these and she said she was stopping them. This prompted me to go into my local branch and get some help. The local Wells Fargo verified the phone number that the calls came from and saw that the XXXX transfer had been stopped and the XXXX XXXX transactions were reversed. They also said the {$9200.00} transaction was in process of being investigated. I again adamantly denied any knowledge of the recipient or that i have EVER made a wire transfer. At that time we closed the compromised checking account and re-opened with a new account number. My on-line access was frozen at that time. 

XX/XX/XXXX : called Wells Fargo On-Line Banking and was able to re-establish my access with new user name and password after receiving the new ATM card. 
XX/XX/XXXX : locked out of my on-line access and had to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to return to the bank and re-establish on-line access and they issued me ANOTHER ATM card. 

XX/XX/XXXX : called the Wells Fargo Fraud dept to check on the status of the investigation and was told there was no claim in process as I didn't have a claim number. In all my phone calls and visits to the branch NO ONE had mentioned a claim number or asked if I had filed a claim. I was lead to believe the investigation was in process. I returned to the branch and asked why a claim had not been filed or why no one asked me about a number. The banker then filed an official claim and also filed an official complaint regarding the fact that no one had bothered to ask the simple question regarding an official claim/number. 

XX/XX/XXXX : called Wells Fargo Claims group and was told they issued a request to XXXX XXXX  to return to stolen funds. 

XX/XX/XXXX : called Wells Fargo Claims group to check status and was told the claim was closed stating XXXX said the money was gone and that account had been closed. Wells Fargo informed me that they had sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX informing me of same but I had not received anything. They promised to have a Senior Escalation officer call me within 2 business days. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received e-mail regarding the Complaint and that they were still investigating and may take until XX/XX/XXXX to complete. 

XX/XX/XXXX : called the Wells Fargo Complaint dept and added the Claim closure notification to my Complaint. Told that I would be contacted in 1-2 days. Went into the branch same day and the banker also called Complaint dept and was told same. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received call from XXXX in Claims stating that they have been unable to retrieve funds and that I was scammed, case was closed and I should try reporting to local police. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received call from Wells Fargo Complaint to let me know they were working on second level investigation. My biggest complaint at this point is that not one Wells Fargo employee in person or on the phone ever asked about the filing of a claim and all stated they saw the investigation in process. 

XX/XX/XXXX : received call from XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank Senior Financial Crimes Investigator/External Fraud Investigations . She heard my concerns and saw all the documentation and that she is looking into it.

Despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter directly with TransUnion, they have failed to take appropriate action and remove the unauthorized inquiries from my credit report. 

I discovered multiple inquiries on my TransUnion credit report that I did not authorize or have any knowledge of. These unauthorized inquiries have adversely affected my credit profile and have the potential to harm my creditworthiness. 

Inquiry details XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX I have made repeated efforts to contact TransUnion, providing them with clear documentation and explanations of the unauthorized inquiries.

As a consumer, I believe this situation violates my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Section 1681i ( a ) of the FCRA stipulates that credit reporting agencies must investigate consumer disputes and remove inaccurate or unauthorized information from credit reports. Furthermore, Section 1681s-2 ( b ) of the FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to promptly correct or delete any inaccurate or unverifiable information.

I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring that TransUnion complies with the relevant consumer protection laws.

I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and request written confirmation once the unauthorized inquiries have been successfully removed from my TransUnion credit report.

XXXX XXXX filled out the dispute form and was assigned File  ID # XXXX by Transunion.

All that this validation indicated was that XXXX XXXX had an account in my name which included a transfer debit of {$2600.00}.

I kindly request your intervention and assistance in addressing these critical issues. 

Underpinning my complaint are three key laws that have been breached by Ally Financial : 15 USC Code 1666b ( Timing of Payments ) : This law establishes guidelines for the timing of payments and emphasizes the prompt crediting and application of payments made by consumers. It ensures that payments are correctly and accurately recorded, benefiting both the consumer and the lender. 

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and Regulation Z : Specifically, TILA section 106 ( a ) ( 1 ) and Regulation Z section 1026.4 ( a ) prohibit the reporting of fees for unanticipated late payments as finance charges. This provision is intended to protect consumers from unfair practices when late fees are assessed due to extenuating circumstances beyond their control. 

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) Section 1024 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) : This law mandates that the CFPB must provide consumers with the information used to substantiate and confirm the validity of their complaints against financial institutions. This ensures transparency and accountability in the resolution of consumer disputes. 

In light of these laws, I have encountered ongoing issues with the reporting of late payments by Ally Financial on my fully paid off auto finance charge. The loan amount of {$16000.00} has been paid in full, and I now own the vehicle outright. However, despite the loan being fully satisfied, Ally Financial continues to report unjustified and inaccurate late payments, adversely affecting my credit history and financial standing. 

Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight that the late payments reported by Ally Financial were directly linked to the unprecedented financial hardships resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. I lost my job during this period, severely impacting my ability to meet financial obligations in a timely manner. Given the extenuating circumstances, it is imperative that these late fees are not reported as finance charges, as specified by TILA and Regulation Z. 

Therefore, I urgently request the CFPB 's intervention to address these violations and rectify the situation. Specifically, I seek the complete removal of the 23 reported late payments from my credit reports. It is of utmost importance that Ally Financial complies with all applicable laws and regulations to protect consumers ' rights, ensure fair lending practices, and accurately reflect the fully paid off status of the auto finance charge. 

Enclosed with this complaint, please find supporting documentation, including relevant account statements, correspondence with Ally Financial, copies of credit reports illustrating the discrepancies in the reported late payments, and evidence of the loan being fully paid off. 

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a thorough review and swift resolution that upholds the rights of consumers, promotes fair and accurate credit reporting, ensures transparency in the complaint resolution process, and reflects the fully satisfied status of the auto finance charge. 

Thank you for your assistance in this regard. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX _______________________________________________________________________ Finance Charge : The finance charge represents the dollar cost of consumer credit and includes any charge imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as a condition of or incident to the extension of credit. It is important to understand which charges should be included and which should not in order to assess the accuracy of reported finance charges. 

Included Charges : Interest Transaction fees Loan origination fees Consumer points Credit guarantee insurance premiums Charges passed on to the consumer for purchasing the loan Discounts for non-credit payment methods Excluded Charges : Charges payable in a comparable cash transaction. 
**Fees for unanticipated late payments. ** Overdraft fees not agreed to in writing.

There are inquiries listed in my consumer report that do not pertain to any transactions initiated by me, as stipulated under 15 U.S. Code 1681c2. 
Upon a careful review of my consumer report, I have identified the following inquiries that I believe to be inaccurately associated with my credit history : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/2023 TRANSUNION - XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 These inquiries have raised concerns regarding the accuracy and integrity of my consumer report. As per the provisions of 15 U.S. Code 1681c2, it is imperative that the information contained within my consumer report accurately reflects my credit history and transactions. The presence of inquiries unrelated to my activities compromises the reliability and fairness of the report, potentially affecting my creditworthiness and future opportunities. 
In light of these discrepancies, I demand that you remove them from my consumer report immediately, as they are not indicative of any transactions initiated by me. I further request that you provide me with a revised copy of my consumer report once the necessary rectifications have been made. 
I trust that you will treat this matter with the utmost urgency and undertake a comprehensive review of my consumer report to rectify the inaccuracies in a timely manner. Failure to address this matter appropriately may result in the escalation of my concerns to the appropriate regulatory authorities.

As 15 U.S. Code 1681c2 states once you receive this information, which will be immediately as I will be submitting through the CFPB, you must block this information not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt of : ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of theconsumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of anidentity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by theconsumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by theconsumerthat the information is not information relating to any transaction by theconsumer.

Which all are in this document. 

This document is drafted by me, XXXX XXXX. It is not made in error nor a misrepresentation of fact. 

Additionally, as mandated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I request that you furnish me with written notification of the actions taken within 30 days from the receipt of this letter. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

I also want to emphasize that I have never given a consumer reporting agency my written consent to include anything on my consumer report, which is against my rights as a customer whose rights are federally protected. The existence of these illegal hard inquiries on my accounts violates my constitutional rights and is an act of identity theft.

Before disclosing any details from the consumer. The consumer reporting agency needs to get authorization in writing as is expressly required by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. Once again, I want to emphasize that I have never given a consumer reporting agency my formal authorization to include any material on my consumer report. The unapproved inquiries on my credit record are a clear breach of this clause as a result.

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681b - Permissible objectives of consumer report ( a ) and ( c ) says that consumer reports may only be obtained for purposes, with the written approval of the consumer. I have not given any written permission for the businesses responsible for obtaining or reporting any details if my credit report is subject to unauthorized requests. Therefore, these unauthorized inquiries also violate this clause. 
I demand the immediate removal of all unapproved hard inquiries that are listed on my accounts. These unlawful queries not only violate my rights as a federally protected consumer but also negatively impact my credit worthiness and financial stability. For my credit report to once again be accurate, honest, and fair, their elimination is essential. 
I kindly request that you investigate the unlawful requests on my credit report in detail, because I, the consumer, did not provide any written authorization. You must comprehend how these unlawful queries violate my rights and could lead to identity theft. I rely on you to provide this matter with your undivided attention and prompt consideration. 
I demand that, as a federally protected consumer, you acknowledge receipt of my dispute letter within the XXXX window specified by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am counting on you to investigate the unauthorized inquiries as soon as possible and make sure they are removed from my credit record. If you don't abide by my request, I might take additional legal action to defend my consumer rights. 
I appreciate your quick response to this situation. I'm hoping for a quick decision that defends my rights, deletes unauthorized inquiries, and corrects the information on my credit report. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you require any additional information or proof to help with the investigation.

2023-07-18,Debt collection,Other debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"I originally held a debt with XXXX XXXX XXXX about 3 years ago from the submission date of this complaint. I called to discuss with their customer service representative before the debt was sent to collections, and it was agreed that the debt was invalid. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent my debt to collections anyways to a company called XXXX XXXXy, if it was in error or out of spite I am not sure. I was able to successfully dispute that debt on my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and it was removed from my credit report promptly. It appears as though this debt was sold to I.C. Systems around XX/XX/XXXX. This was done without first notifying them that the debt was found invalid already on the part of XXXX XXXX, and they recently published another collection remark on my credit report for the same debt account. 

As far as I'm aware, it is illegal to duplicate a mark on someone's credit twice for the same debt account, regardless of if it's valid or invalid. This puts either I.C. Systems or XXXX XXXX at risk for litigation, as it goes against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and could potentially be considered harassment or an attempt to damage my credit in retaliation for successfully disputing it. Note, it has been disputed again, and found invalid on XX/XX/XXXX. This debt has been found invalid by each of the 3 credit reporting bureaus as well. 

I would like to have this matter dealt with and this debt dropped. It's an invalid debt stemming from either a clerical error or miscommunication on the part of a customer service representative. I would like to put an end to the harassment and attempts to damage my credit, and if possible I would like to see legal ramifications levied against XXXX XXXX for selling invalid debt to another collection agency, and against I.C. Systems for double reporting an invalid debt to a credit bureau. In addition, XXXX XXXX XXXX should be held liable for going against a verbal agreement and selling invalid debt to collections, but that is a matter for the collections companies to deal with and not me. 

I've done my duty of disputing this debt on multiple occasions through multiple companies. I have reached out directly to I.C. Systems to dispute the debt with them today as well. I think 3 years of weekly to daily calls and emails is more than enough to constitute harassment, not to mention they never leave a voicemail so it is impossible to identify the company or account and dispute it with them without calling and being harassed and told to pay up.

They have no intention of removing the PMI despite valid comps. They wont let us have an independent assessment done- they said it wouldnt count in their decision.

I wrote Citi again explaining the merchant used canny methods to get me to buy ( pretending to be another company online ) and then wouldn't let me return the goods for a refund in a reasonable manner ( without paying shipping cost from US to XXXX ). 
I looked up the merchant on the XXXX and it has many reports of scamming, it has a rating of F, but still Citi sided with the merchant only because the merchant is wise enough to have all the required information to show the bank they are legit.

2023-07-17,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I have a Citi credit card that has a balance consisting of two balance transfers- one at 0.00 % ( {$2400.00} ) and another at 0.99 % ( {$6400.00} ). The balance transfer at 0.00 % was set to expire on XX/XX/2023, at which time the rate would increase to 24.99 %. I made a payment for the full amount of that balance transfer 's remaining balance ( {$2400.00} ) on XX/XX/2023. My statement then cut off on XX/XX/2023. Citi applied all of my XX/XX/2023 payment to the balance transfer balance with the 0.99 % rate because they pay down the higher interest rate balance first ( to benefit the consumer? ). That not only resulted in my expiring balance transfer balance jumping to 24.99 %, but it paid down the other balance transfer balance that I just gotten in XX/XX/2023 and paid a fee to obtain. I have reached out to Citi via chat on multiple occasions. The first was to ask if my payment can be reapplied to the expiring balance transfer. The option to have a payment reapplied is in Citi 's Help FAQs and I went that route, but I received a letter in the mail days later saying that request was denied. I then chatted with a representative asking if I could get an understanding of why it was denied and was given a copy of the payment processing order. I explained the situation and was again denied. I then chatted with a "" supervisor '' who approved me getting a refund of {$2300.00} ( to make sure what was paid covers the minimum payment ) credited back to my bank account. This was I could make the payment and have it applied now to this high-rate balance. I was told the refund would go right to my bank account. Now 7-10 days later, I check and still no refund. I chatted with Citi again only to be told that the refund was denied. I explained that I am paying over {$50.00} a month in interest because I paid off my balance transfer on time and had I paid it 1-2 days later, I would not be being charged all of this interest. I was told he would try to get it refunded again, but I expressed my concern for the payment application practice and their unwillingness to work with consumers as I feel that the balance transfer policy, expiration dates, statement dates, and payment application practices are misleading and harmful to consumers. I continue to be charged interest at a very high rate until I can pay that off and in the meantime I am not getting the benefit of the low-rate balance transfer that was offered to me ( which again, I paid a fee to obtain ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MI,486XX,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7261993

Late fee was still there and now another for XXXX.

There is no prior history of returned checks ( unpaid ) or other payment problems not created by the card issuer. 
My credit report has been negatively affected by this random and uncalled for payment verification process. They claim there is no escalation, no process to dispute, no reason in their records specific to my situation but a long paragraph of reasons it could happen.

These accounts were previously removed by TransUnion in XXXX due to being re-aged by the original creditor Navient ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX attached ). Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, TransUnion was obligated to notify me, in writing, no more than ( 5 ) business days after re-inserting these accounts onto my credit report ( this did not happen ). TransUnion received a credit dispute from me on XX/XX/XXXX, regarding the matter and other discrepancies found on my consumer report. ( credit dispute letter and certified mail receipt attached ). 

TransUnion failed to investigate the issue and did not respond to my credit dispute. In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted TransUnion by phone, on a recorded line, and spoke with a supervisor who confirmed that my dispute results were never mailed out. I filed a complaint with the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX ( complaint # XXXX attached ) regarding TransUnion 's nonresponse. On XX/XX/XXXX, TransUnion responded to the complaint stating, "" We have removed the identified items from your TransUnion credit report. '' They also informed me that I would receive an updated credit report within 7 business days.

It's been ( 15 ) business days and I have yet to receive an updated credit report showing the items they claimed to have deleted. I did not receive an alert from my credit monitoring services that these accounts were ever removed so I pulled my credit report ( 10 ) business days after the complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX credit report attached ). TransUnion was still reporting these accounts. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, all ( 11 ) US Dept of Education accounts and the XXXX XXXX late payment continues to report ( today 's credit report attached ).

I called Ally bank immediately. The CSR I spoke with said she understood the urgency and was very nice and empathetic. Then she dropped the bombshell. It would be 10 business days before I would hear from them about the investigation into the debits and it would come by mail. 

I cant remember if it was when I spoke to her or the next person that I started asking how in the world did this thief get not one l, not 2, but 5 of these through their bank? And she corrected me saying there was actually another one but it didnt go through. I said yea, it didnt go through because I was out of money, not because your fraud detection woke up. 

I was clearly in XXXX in possession of my card since I used it that day more than once. Then, these thieves come along and start charging the same amount over and over and Ally did nothing. No red flag, no fraud alert, no call to me. Nothing. But the worst part is they are taking no responsibility. They are following what they call their standard policy on fraud disputes. Meanwhile they left me in a position of XXXX  funds. They dont give provisional credit and run the investigation. You are stuck until they finish the investigation.

I was told that the dispute had been resolved in my favor and that the {$5.00} had been refunded to my account. I asked why the {$6.00} in rewards points wasn't showing in my rewards balance, and the agent couldnt provide me with an answer. I then had to wait a long time while she went to ask someone else. Eventually I was put through to someone in the rewards department. I explained the problem yet again, and this time was told that they couldn't add the funds back to my rewards account. I asked how I was supposed to receive a refund for the {$6.00} spent on an item which hadn't arrived and had been partially refunded. I also pointed out that in fact I'd been told by 3 people that in fact the amount WOULD be credited to my rewards. This agent said this wasn't possible. This is blatantly untrue. It would have been very simple to add the amount of {$6.00} to my rewards balance. But the agent just didn't want to go to the trouble to find out how to go about doing it.

Despite notifying XXXX twice through each credit bureau about the erroneous information they have reported on my credit file, they have continuously failed to rectify the issue. 

Exhibit A : FCRA Violations by XXXX Violation 1 : Failure to Provide Disclosures XXXX did not provide any disclosures before reporting my credit information, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 609 ( a ) ( 2 ). Potential statutory damages for this violation amount to {$100.00} to {$1000.00}.

Violation 2 : Lack of Opt-Out Options XXXX neglected to provide me with any opt-out options, contravening FCRA, Section 609 ( e ). Potential statutory damages for this violation amount to {$100.00} to {$1000.00}.

Violation 3 : Absence of Privacy Disclosures XXXX failed to furnish any privacy disclosures as mandated by FCRA, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ). Potential statutory damages for this violation amount to {$100.00} to {$1000.00}.

Violation 4 : Inaccurate Reporting XXXX continued to report erroneous information despite being informed of the inaccuracies twice, violating FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Potential actual damages for this violation may include any losses I suffered due to their inaccurate reporting.

Violation 5 : Lack of Data Redundancy XXXX reported conflicting information to each credit bureau, displaying a lack of data redundancy and accurate record-keeping, violating FCRA, Section 607 ( b ). Potential actual damages for this violation may include any losses I incurred due to their poor record-keeping.

Exhibit B : Potential Monetary Awards Violation 1 : Failure to Provide Disclosures - {$1000.00} Violation 2 : Lack of Opt-Out Options - {$1000.00} Violation 3 : Absence of Privacy Disclosures - {$1000.00} Violation 4 : Inaccurate Reporting - Actual damages to be determined in court Violation 5 : Lack of Data Redundancy - Actual damages to be determined in court Potential Total Monetary Award in Court : {$3000.00} ( statutory damages ) + Actual damages for Violation 4 + Actual damages for Violation 5 I believe that XXXXXXXX XXXX continuous disregard for FCRA regulations has caused significant damage to my financial standing and well-being upwards of {$10000.00}. Despite giving them ample time to rectify their errors, they persist with frivolous furnishings, leading me to seek justice through legal action. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and hold XXXX responsible for their actions. Your intervention is essential in upholding consumer rights and ensuring fair and accurate credit reporting practices. 

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take appropriate action to remedy this situation and protect the interests of consumers like myself.

I had made a payment plan with XXXX XXXX prior to that and had followed it accordingly. When they reported my payment late, I called and spoke to the general manager XXXX XXXX ( he was also the one who helped me set up the payment plan ). He admitted it was a mistake on their end and it should have never been reported. I asked him to resolve it and he was very flighty, it took me 4 times of asking him until he said he would need to submit something to the credit department but it would take a long time. I said that was fine. Since he kept complaining about it I asked for the credit departments contact information and he said they dont give it out to customers and only he can do it. After 2 months I reached out to XXXX because it was still on my credit report and he said oh I assumed they fixed it because I didnt hear anything and said nothing else can be done. So I filed a claim with each bureau explaining this and all were denied except one. I resubmitted and they were still denied. XXXX said they couldnt do anything about it even though I reminded them they admitted it was their mistake. I asked for a Corporate phone number and they said they didnt have one. I then began working with a credit repair agency and they said this sounded shady, and have been working on removing this from my credit report at the other 2 bureaus but they have been unsuccessful. So it is still on my credit report even though XXXX admitted it was their mistake. 
Aside from this major issue, XXXX has been EXTREMELY rude and insulting in every interaction I have ever had with him. They have also called over XXXX times in XXXX day for days on end.

The promotion offered a {$400.00} bonus for opening a new checking account. The requirements were 1 ) open a new Truist One Checking account, and 2 ) complete at least two qualifying direct deposits, totaling {$1000.00} or more and be made within 90 days of account opening. After confirming my eligibility I went ahead and opened a Truist checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Truist Customer Service to ask why I hadn't received the bonus. The customer representative told me that I was eligible and I should have received the bonus. After an hour ( ONE HOUR ) on the phone, the representative told me that I hadn't met criteria # 2. However, my records ( Truist banking statements ) show the following direct deposits : XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} XX/XX/2023 {$1000.00} After ANOTHER HOUR the representative told that I wasn't qualified because I had another Truist One Checking account. The representative told me they couldn't find the account, and by the way it doesn't appear on my banking statements, doesn't appear to my online portal, and frankly doesn't exist. 

In addition, my account was charged {$3.00} the past four months. And since the account earns no interest, every time I transferred to another bank, they will charge me another {$3.00} fee.

As I investigated further, I saw that there was {$970.00} in charges to this newly opened Barclays Banana Republic credit card account. I was very confused as I know I only have one Barclays account and I have never shopped at Banana Republic. I immediately called Barclays ( XX/XX/2023 ), reported it as fraud, had an investigation opened and the account closed. I also made an account on IdentityTheft.gov and went through their "" Recovery Plan '' which suggested I place a credit freeze and fraud alert on my credit reports as well as an extended fraud alert, which I did.

Today ( XX/XX/2023 ) I checked my credit score again and the {$970.00} in charges were back on my report and the remark on my account now stated "" Account previously in dispute - Now resolved by data furnisher ''. Again, I immediately called the Barclays fraud department. They said that their investigation determined it couldn't be fraud as you have to present an ID to get the Banana Republic card.
